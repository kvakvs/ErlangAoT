# ErlangAoT
This repository contains two things:

* Ahead-of-time translator from Erlang (TODO: Decide kernel or core Erlang) to LLVM IR using simplified term memory format and a simplified process model.
* Runtime library that together with translated file will give a binary executable.
* Bonus points for preparing this to work in OS-less environments.
