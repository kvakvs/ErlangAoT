# ErlangAoT

An ahead-of-time compiler project for Erlang/OTP 29. It preprocesses, parses,
analyzes and compiles a small integer/parameter/direct-call subset to LLVM IR,
bitcode and native objects. Generated code executes through test-owned native
harnesses and the runtime; a production executable launcher remains unimplemented.

The compilation contract is described in [docs/compile.md](docs/compile.md),
including its LLVM SDK requirements and provisional ABI.
The separate runtime now supports [startup, context ownership and shutdown](docs/runtime-lifecycle.md),
with a reusable CMake target for linking native consumers.
All APIs are project-internal C++23; C compatibility is deferred until needed.

Current generated-code validation is Windows x64: native O0/O2 execution,
OTP differential comparisons, runtime ASan and the full compiler/runtime quality
gate. ELF/Mach-O/COFF objects are inspected for seven targets; other native hosts
remain pending. Earlier macOS evidence covers the foundational/runtime work.
See the [validation inventory and limitations](docs/compile-validation.md).

The [compiled-module example](examples/compile/) contains two Erlang modules,
a C++ harness and an LLVM-free CMake runtime link recipe. Follow the
[emission, inspection and native execution commands](docs/compile.md#run-the-compiled-module-example).

## Features

- Preprocessing: macros, includes, conditional compilation and language features.
- OTP 29 syntax: expressions, patterns, records, bitstrings, types/specifications,
  control flow and comprehensions.
- Syntax checking, expanded Erlang source output and an indented syntax-tree view.
- Source diagnostics and multiple input files.
- Compilation subset checks, parameter bindings, batch call resolution and declared
  type/specification analysis; see [semantic analysis](docs/semantic.md).
- LLVM O0/O2 compilation, explicit per-module artifacts, IR snapshots and declared/inferred type reports.
- TOML projects with named targets, source discovery, per-target frontend options,
  and annotated starter files.

## Build

Requirements:

- CMake 3.28+ and a C++23-capable compiler.
- On Windows, an installed Clang executable on `PATH` or under `Program Files/LLVM/bin`;
  configuration fails immediately if it is missing or cannot run.
- LLVM 23.1.x (>=23.1.1) C++ SDK for compiler builds. CMake prefers a global
  installation, then downloads the pinned 23.1.2 SDK into `thirdparty/` if missing;
  see [SDK setup and compilation contract](docs/compile.md).
- Boost 1.90+ with Boost.Multiprecision for compiler and runtime; the compiler also
  requires Boost.Parser. Multiprecision is header-only and needs no Boost binary library.
- toml++ 3.4.0 for project manifests; see [dependency setup](docs/projects.md#build-dependency).
- Erlang/OTP 29+ when tests are enabled with `-DBUILD_TESTING=ON`.
  Ordinary builds omit tests and do not require Erlang.

On macOS:

```sh
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake boost erlang tomlplusplus llvm@23
```

On Windows, install LLVM/Clang globally for the host compiler tools.
Install Visual Studio's **Desktop development with C++** workload and a Windows SDK,
plus Ninja. Use an **x64 Native Tools** command prompt or Developer PowerShell
configured for x64, with `clang-cl`, `cmake`, and `ninja` on `PATH`.
CMake checks the MSVC ABI, Windows SDK linkage, and C++23 `std::expected` support.
The LLVM command-line tools alone do not provide the required C++ SDK; CMake
downloads it separately when `LLVMConfig.cmake` and matching libraries are absent.

CMake downloads Boost 1.90.0 and toml++ 3.4.0 into the ignored `thirdparty/`
directory on first use, verifies their SHA-256 checksums, and retains both archives
and extracted sources. Subsequent configurations, including fresh build directories,
reuse those files without network access. Removing `build/` does not remove dependencies.
Runtime-only builds download only Boost. Explicit dependency roots below take
precedence and allow offline setup; an invalid explicit root fails without downloading.
Linux and macOS continue to use installed dependencies or local `thirdparty/` sources.
LLVM SDK fallback downloads apply on **all three platforms**, with SHA-256-pinned
official archives for Windows x64/ARM64, Linux x64/ARM64, and macOS ARM64.
Archives and extracted SDKs stay in `thirdparty/` for offline reuse. Other host
architectures and cross-builds require an explicit matching `LLVM_DIR`.

For compiler builds, LLVM's zlib and zstd dependencies are detected from installed
libraries. On Windows, missing libraries trigger SHA-256-verified downloads of
zlib 1.3.2 and zstd 1.5.7, followed by static Debug/Release builds under `thirdparty/`.
These builds are reused across build directories and match the host compiler,
architecture and CRT. Set `ZLIB_ROOT` or `zstd_ROOT` to prefer an installed library;
`ERLANG_AOT_DOWNLOAD_ZLIB=OFF` and `ERLANG_AOT_DOWNLOAD_ZSTD=OFF` disable the respective
fallbacks. MSVC SDK discovery rejects cached MinGW `.a` libraries such as those
bundled with Strawberry Perl. Linux and macOS use installed development packages.

From the repository root:

```sh
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug
```

On Windows, use the clang-cl/Ninja Multi-Config preset from the developer shell:

```powershell
cmake --preset windows
cmake --build --preset windows-debug
cmake --build --preset windows-release
```

Tests and their helper executables are opt-in. Configure explicitly for testing:

```sh
cmake --preset debug -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build --preset debug
ctest --preset debug --no-tests=error
```

On Windows:

```powershell
cmake --preset windows -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build --preset windows-debug
ctest --preset windows-debug --no-tests=error
cmake --build --preset windows-release
ctest --preset windows-release --no-tests=error
```

For a build directory without a preset, pass `-DBUILD_TESTING=ON` to `cmake -S . -B <dir>`
for testing. CMake caches this setting; pass `-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF` when reusing that
directory for ordinary builds. The normal presets and build wrappers set it to `OFF`.

The batch scripts mirror the Makefile's `build`, `format`, and `clean` targets:
`make-build.bat`, `make-test.bat`, `make-format.bat`, and `make-clean.bat`. Run them from a Visual
Studio developer shell with CMake and Clang available. Build defaults are
`BUILD_DIR=build/debug`, `BUILD_TYPE=Debug`, and native build tool parallelism
(override with `JOBS=N`); environment variables
`CMAKE`, `CTEST`, `CMAKE_ARGS`, and `CLANG_FORMAT` also override the corresponding tools/options.
`make-test.bat` configures with testing enabled, builds all targets, then runs CTest,
matching `make test` and propagating configuration, build, or test failures.
Clean removes repository-local `build/` and `cmake-build*/` directories.

`erlangaot.bat --help` builds first, then forwards all arguments to the selected
configuration's executable. Build failures stop execution; compiler input paths
remain relative to the caller's working directory, and its exit code is preserved.

For runtime development without downloading or using the LLVM C++ SDK, configure with
`cmake --preset windows -DERLANG_AOT_BUILD_COMPILER=OFF`; the same build/test presets
apply. Set the option back to `ON` when the SDK is available. MSVC `cl` is also
accepted in a separate build directory; MinGW is not supported for native Windows
development builds. Select x86 or x64 through the developer environment (or `-A`
with a Visual Studio generator), and use an LLVM SDK and runtime of that architecture.

The Windows default CRT is `/MDd` for Debug and `/MD` for other configurations,
including the static runtime library and its consumers. An explicit
`CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY` setting is preserved; it must match the LLVM SDK and
all linked C++ libraries. Avoid mixing Debug and Release STL/CRT artifacts.
Windows project sources and CLI/path fixtures use UTF-8.

All project targets use C++23 and treat compiler warnings as errors.
The executable is `build/debug/bin/erlangaot`. Build presets and wrappers request
parallel builds on Windows, Linux, and macOS using the native build tool's default
job count (`jobs: 0` in presets, `--parallel` in wrappers). Set an explicit limit
with `cmake --build --preset debug --parallel 8` or `JOBS=8` for the wrappers.
For a build directory without a preset, use `cmake --build <dir> --parallel`.
The Windows preset places the executable in `build/windows/bin/<Config>/erlangaot.exe`
and the runtime in `build/windows/lib/<Config>/erlang_runtime.lib`.

Alternatively, use `make build` to build only `erlangaot` and its dependencies,
or `make test` to build and run the full test suite. For a different configuration:

```sh
make test BUILD_DIR=build/release BUILD_TYPE=Release JOBS=4
```

CMake discovers installed Boost and Erlang, including Homebrew installations.
Pass these options when configuring to override defaults:

| Option                                      | Purpose                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-DERLANG_AOT_BOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost`    | Select a Boost installation or full source tree               |
| `-DERLANG_AOT_TOML_ROOT=/path/to/tomlplusplus-3.4.0` | Select the pinned TOML dependency |
| `-DERLANG_AOT_ESCRIPT=/path/to/bin/escript` | Select an Erlang installation; versions below 29 are rejected |
| `-DERLANG_AOT_CLANG_EXECUTABLE=C:/path/to/clang.exe` | Select an installed Windows Clang executable |
| `-DLLVM_DIR=/prefix/lib/cmake/llvm` | Select an existing LLVM 23.1.x SDK (invalid explicit paths fail) |
| `-DERLANG_AOT_DOWNLOAD_LLVM=OFF` | Require an installed SDK; disable automatic LLVM downloads |
| `-DBUILD_TESTING=ON`                        | Enable tests, helper executables and their Erlang dependency (default: OFF) |
| `-DERLANG_AOT_BUILD_COMPILER=OFF`           | Build only the runtime library                                |
| `-DERLANG_AOT_BUILD_RUNTIME=OFF`            | Build only the compiler                                       |

For multi-configuration generators, add `--config Debug` when building and
`-C Debug` when testing. CMake-aware IDEs can open the repository using the
`debug` preset, or the `windows` preset with a Visual Studio development toolchain.

Boost and toml++ headers use CMake `SYSTEM` includes, keeping warnings as errors
for project code. On native macOS builds, CMake also marks Homebrew's linked include
directory as `SYSTEM` when its Boost headers resolve to the selected installation.
This keeps inherited flags such as `CXXFLAGS=-I/opt/homebrew/include` from exposing
Boost warnings, including when that flag is already cached by CMake.
For other installations, avoid adding dependency paths through global `-I` flags (including
`CXXFLAGS`): an ordinary include path can take precedence over a dependency's
system path. If CLion reports Boost warnings as errors, remove those global flags
and clear the cached value, for example:

```sh
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-debug -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=
```

Then reload CMake in CLion. Use the dependency root options above to select
installations instead of adding global include flags.

## Usage

```sh
./build/debug/bin/erlangaot --parse-check examples/project/src/main.erl
./build/debug/bin/erlangaot --print-pp -I include -DDEBUG examples/project/src/main.erl
./build/debug/bin/erlangaot --print-ast examples/project/src/main.erl
```

On macOS, `./run-macos.sh --parse-check examples/project/src/main.erl` builds first
and runs the latest executable, passing all arguments unchanged. It accepts `BUILD_DIR`,
`BUILD_TYPE` and `JOBS` environment overrides.

```text
erlangaot [options] <source.erl>...
  --project <path>        Read a TOML project instead of positional sources
  --target <name>         Select a target; repeat for more (default: all)
  --new-project <filename>  Create an annotated starter; append .toml when needed
  --preprocess-check       Check preprocessing only
  --parse-check            Preprocess and check syntax
  --print-pp               Print expanded Erlang source
  --print-ast              Print an indented syntax tree
  --print-types            Report declared/inferred types before LLVM lowering
  --print-ir               Print verified IR before LLVM optimization
  --print-optimized-ir     Print verified IR after LLVM optimization
  --emit obj|llvm-ir|llvm-bc  Write one artifact per module
  --artifact-dir <dir>     Override the artifact root (requires --emit)
  --target-triple <triple>  Select the machine/OS/ABI
  -O0 / -O2               Generic O0 (default) / speed optimization
  --no-type-specialization  Disable compiler variants at either optimization level
  --verbose               Trace files and compilation phases to stderr
  --impldebug <n[,n...]>   Enable debug output for selected implementation steps
  -I, --include <dir>      Add an include directory (last supplied searched first)
  -D, --define <name[=term]>  Define a macro (default value: true)
  --app-dir <app=dir>      Set an include_lib application directory
  --enable-feature <name>  Enable a language feature
  --disable-feature <name> Disable a language feature
  -h, --help              Show all options
  --version               Show version
  --                      Treat remaining arguments as input paths
```

Quote paths containing spaces and macro values containing shell punctuation:

```sh
./build/debug/bin/erlangaot --parse-check -I include '-DVERSION={1,0}' \
  --app-dir myapp=examples/project examples/project/src/main.erl
```

Check modes are silent on success; diagnostics go to stderr. Print modes write
to stdout and can be combined: `--print-pp --print-ast` prints source before the
tree for each input. Adding `--preprocess-check` does not disable parsing requested
by `--parse-check` or `--print-ast`. Errors may leave partial printed output.

With no check/print action, source inputs and `--project` run the complete pipeline
through verified native object buffers in memory. Positional inputs form one batch;
each project target forms its own batch. `--emit` writes artifacts under `build/aot`
or `--artifact-dir`; projects append an encoded target name and use a manifest-relative
default root. Filenames encode module identity. No production executable is linked;
`--output` explicitly fails with `[executable linking] notimpl`; TOML `output` remains reserved metadata.

```sh
erlangaot -O2 --emit obj answer.erl client.erl
erlangaot --print-ir --print-optimized-ir -O2 answer.erl
erlangaot --print-types answer.erl client.erl
```

IR inspection allows both stages together and stops before object emission. Multiple
snapshots are separate modules; use `--emit llvm-ir` for individual assembly files.
Type inspection stops before LLVM and distinguishes contracts, inferred facts and
unknown inputs. It accepts preprocessing/project/verbosity options, but rejects other
actions, output destinations and backend policy. See [compilation options](docs/compile.md).

`--verbose` prints `[pp] <filename>` for source files and resolved preprocessor
includes, and `[parse] <filename>` when each source enters the parser. Nested and
library includes are traced as they are loaded; inactive includes are skipped.
The parser consumes expanded tokens incrementally, so its trace can precede include
traces. `[comp]` adds semantic/backend phases and bounded specialization decisions
as they start. Tracing goes to stderr in every mode, including projects.

`--impldebug 23` or `--impldebug 23,24,27` selects optional implementation-step
debug output independently of `--verbose`. Repeated options combine their selections;
duplicates are ignored. Values are signed 32-bit decimal integers, with optional
`+`/`-` signs and no spaces or empty list members. Steps 23–27 print inferred function
inputs/results and parameter relations to stderr with the selected step prefix
(for example, `[impldebug 27]`). These are analyzed lowering inputs, not an IR dump.
Future steps can check their own number; selecting a step without debug output has
no effect. The same selection applies to positional inputs and every selected
project target. Frontend-only check/print actions do not run inference.

Exit codes: **0** for success (including warnings), **1** for source/project errors,
**2** for usage errors or unknown target names.
Each input has independent preprocessing state; any source error makes the overall command fail.

Syntax checks do not validate semantics or execute parse transforms. Check/print
modes do not create output files and reject `-o`/`--output`. Default compilation
also writes no executable yet.

See [preprocessing](docs/preprocessor.md), [parser usage](docs/parser.md) and
[validation status](docs/parser-validation.md) for further details.

## Projects

Run the included two-target example:

```sh
./build/debug/bin/erlangaot --parse-check --project examples/project/project.toml
./build/debug/bin/erlangaot --print-ast --project examples/project/project.toml --target app
./build/debug/bin/erlangaot --preprocess-check --project examples/project/project.toml --target tests --target app
```

Create an annotated project in an existing directory:

```sh
mkdir -p build/project-demo
./build/debug/bin/erlangaot --new-project build/project-demo/demo
mkdir -p build/project-demo/src
cp examples/project/src/main.erl build/project-demo/src/main.erl
./build/debug/bin/erlangaot --parse-check --project build/project-demo/demo.toml
```

Creation writes only the requested TOML file and refuses existing destinations.
The starter contains one `app` target using `src`, with all frontend options at
their defaults. Add source files before checking it.

Manifest paths are relative to the TOML file; CLI paths are relative to the
invocation directory. All targets run by default. Repeat `--target` to choose an
ordered subset; repeat selections run once. `sources` supports literal filenames
and `*`, `?`, `**` patterns; `source_dirs` recursively discovers `.erl` files.
Source search paths only locate explicitly listed files. CLI include paths take
precedence, CLI application roots replace matching names, CLI feature settings
apply last, and duplicate macro definitions remain errors.

See [project format and workflows](docs/projects.md) and
[project validation evidence](docs/project-validation.md). Projects support all
four frontend modes; executable generation remains unimplemented.
