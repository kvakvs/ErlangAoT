# Profiling

`--profile FILE` (a [runtime option](executables.md#runtime-options), also
through `CLAUSE_FLAGS`) makes a program write a cost report to `FILE` when it
ends (plan 11 step 61, backlog F31). Nothing is recompiled: every executable
can profile, and without the option it runs, prints and writes files exactly
as before. A report that cannot be written is reported on stderr
(`clau: cannot write profile FILE`); the exit status stays the program's.

## Attribution

The runtime attributes costs where control moves between frames
([execution model](execution-model.md)), with no instrumentation in generated
code:

- **Entries** (reductions): every entry of an Erlang function through a call or
  tail call counts one for that function, as a time slice counts reductions.
- **Self time**: steady-clock time from one transfer (entry, return, start of a
  time slice) to the next belongs to the function whose frame was on top.
  Builtins and runtime services count as time of the function that called them;
  time while a process waits or is not scheduled counts for nobody. Time before
  the first entry of a process is `(runtime)`.
- **Per process**: each process keeps its own costs; they are added to the
  program's when the process's context is destroyed, with its pid, totals and
  most expensive function.

Each enabled stack reads the clock at every transfer (about 8% slower on a
call-dense loop in Debug); disabled stacks pay one branch per transfer.

```

Functions are `module:function/arity` (anonymous funs by their generated
names, whose arity counts captured values); ties sort by name, processes by
time then pid. Times are in microseconds and vary between runs; entries are
exact.

## Tests

`linking_profiling` links `tests/fixtures/linking/profile` at O0 and O2 and
runs it without profiling, with `--profile FILE` and with
`CLAUSE_FLAGS=--profile=FILE`: the output is identical, `spin/2` ranks first
by self time with exactly 2,000,001 entries, the spinning process ranks first,
and `--profile` without a file fails with exit 70.
