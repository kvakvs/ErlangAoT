# Semantic analysis

Runs after parsing in default compilation and `--print-types`; syntax-only
actions skip it. Errors stop the affected batch before LLVM; diagnostics keep
macro/include origins, and later inputs are still diagnosed.

## Module and call checks

- Module declaration required and unique; function arities 0..255; no duplicate
  definitions; every export exists (a repeated export warns, as in OTP). Quoted/Unicode names keep
  their exact identity.
- Every function is checked, including unused and unreachable code.
- Calls resolve within the batch by module/name/arity. Remote calls (including
  self-qualified) require exports. Missing/private callees and duplicate
  modules are errors.
- `fun F/A` must name a function of the module (`function F/A undefined`);
  `fun M:F/A` and calls of values (`F(Args)`) are not resolved at compile time
  ([funs](funs.md)). Each distinct fun value gets a `Module::funs` entry after
  binding analysis.
- Self, mutual and cross-module recursion are accepted. The call graph is split
  into strongly connected components (iterative Tarjan) in callee-before-caller
  order; a component is recursive when it has several members or a member
  calls itself.

## Behaviours

Plan 11 step 65A, following OTP's
[behaviours](https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/design_principles.html#behaviours),
`erl_internal:add_predefined_functions` and `erl_lint`'s `check_behaviour`.

- A module declaring `-callback` gets OTP's predefined, exported
  `behaviour_info/1`: `callbacks` gives the declared callbacks in source order,
  `optional_callbacks` those of the well-formed `-optional_callbacks` lists
  (callbacks qualified with a module are left out). The frontend appends it
  as a function at the `-module` line (`driver/predefined`). As in OTP the
  module's own source cannot name it: an `-export`, local call, `fun
  behaviour_info/1` or `-spec` of it is an undefined function; remote calls
  (also self-qualified) reach it. `-callback` beside a hand-written
  `behaviour_info/1` is an error
  (`cannot define callback attibute for F/A when behaviour_info is defined`,
  OTP's spelling).
- `-behaviour(M)` and `-behavior(M)` may repeat. `M` resolves in the batch; a
  name with a library module (`library.md`) adds that module like a literal
  call does. Diagnostics use OTP's text at the attribute name:
  - `undefined callback function F/A (behaviour 'M')` for each required,
    non-optional callback the module does not export (sorted);
  - `conflicting behaviours -- callback F/A required by both 'M2' and 'M1'
    (line L, column C)` when an earlier behaviour also requires it (an
    optional callback counts when exported);
  - `behaviour M undefined` when `M` is not in the batch or has no
    `behaviour_info/1` (OTP behaviours such as `gen_server` are not part of
    Clause yet), plus OTP's module-name errors for names that cannot be
    modules (`the module name must not be empty`, `... must be an atom`, ...).
- Warnings do not fail compilation. `-compile` options `nowarn_behaviours`
  (the whole check, module-name errors included), `nowarn_undefined_behaviour_func`,
  `nowarn_undefined_behaviour` and `nowarn_conflicting_behaviours` turn them
  off.
- Not evaluated: a hand-written exported `behaviour_info/1` of a behaviour
  module, so its users' callbacks are not checked, and OTP's ill-defined
  and deprecated-callback warnings never occur
  ([differences](differences.md#errors-stack-traces-and-reports)).
- Evidence: `tests/fixtures/lint` (OTP-generated diagnostics, CTest
  `lint_diagnostics`), `executables_behaviours`, `semantic` CLI cases.

## Imports

Plan 11 step 65C, following `erl_lint`'s import rules.

- `-import(Module, [F/A, ...])` makes a local call `F(...)` the remote call
  `Module:F(...)`: the module must be in the batch (a library module joins it
  like a literal call) and export the function, or be a builtin module
  (`-import(io, [format/2])`, `-import(erlang, [display/1])`). An import
  takes precedence over an auto-imported BIF of the same name.
- Errors with OTP's text: `function F/A already imported from M` (the whole
  attribute is then ignored), `defining imported function F/A`,
  `creating a fun from imported name F/A is not allowed`. An imported
  function in a guard is an illegal guard call (except erlang guard BIFs).
- Warning `import directive overrides auto-imported BIF F/A -- ...` unless
  `no_auto_import` names it or `nowarn_bif_clash` is given; Clause knows the
  auto-imported BIFs it implements.
- Evidence: `executables_imports`, lint cases `imports_conflicts`,
  `imports_fun`, `imports_bif`, semantic CLI cases.

## Predefined functions

Plan 11 step 65B, following OTP's
[modules](https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/modules.html) and
`erl_internal:add_predefined_functions`. The frontend appends
`module_info/0,1` to every compiled module (after a generated
`behaviour_info/1`) as Erlang functions returning literal data
(`driver/predefined`, `semantic/module_info`); `Module::predefined_` counts
these trailing forms, which are always exported and left out of
`--print-types`.

- `module_info()` gives `[{module,_},{exports,_},{attributes,_},{compile,_},{md5,_}]`;
  `module_info(Key)` also answers `functions`, `nifs` (`[]`) and `native`
  (`false`), and raises `badarg` for any other key.
- `exports`: the exported functions in definition order (escripts add
  `main/1`), then `behaviour_info/1` when generated, `module_info/0`,
  `module_info/1`. `functions`: every function in definition order, then the
  same predefined ones.
- `attributes`: every attribute except `module`, exports and imports,
  type/spec/callback forms, records, `export_type`, `optional_callbacks`,
  `export_record`, `compile`, `file`, documentation and `feature`, in source
  order; a value that is not a list is wrapped in one (`-tags(a)` is
  `{tags,[a]}`). Without `-vsn`, `{vsn,[N]}` comes first, `N` being `md5` read
  as an unsigned big-endian integer, as OTP derives it.
- `md5`: MD5 of the module's printed source (`print_source`: macros expanded,
  includes inlined, comments and layout dropped). `compile`:
  `[{version,ClauseVersion},{options,[]},{source,AbsolutePath}]`.
- Unlike `behaviour_info/1`, the module's own source sees them: local calls
  and `fun module_info/1` work. Defining either is an error
  (`function module_info/0 already defined`); exporting one, like any repeated
  export, only warns (`function module_info/0 already exported`).
- Attributes are data; only `on_load`, `nifs` and non-inert `-compile`
  options are rejected as behavior-changing.
- The generated functions have no source line (OTP gives them none): no
  debug locations, IR source comments or `--print-types` entries.
  `module_info/0` holds the same literals as `module_info/1`, so it makes no
  calls.
- Evidence: `executables_module_info` (OTP stdout; derived values by shape),
  `tests/fixtures/lint` cases `module_info_defined`, `exports_repeated`.

## Bindings

Each binding has a function-relative identity `clause[N].local[M]`. Occurrences
are definitions, reads or exact-equality checks, tagged with head/guard/body
context. Analysis is deterministic.

- Each clause starts from an empty environment. Head candidates collect
  tentative definitions; guards read them; the body sees them only on success.
- `_` binds nothing; `_Name` is an ordinary variable. A repeated name is an
  exact-equality constraint.
- Body matches visit RHS before LHS; chains are right-to-left. A parenthesized
  pattern `P1 = P2` is an alias, not a sequence.
- Sibling expressions read the same incoming names; their definitions export
  after the whole expression. `{X = 1, X}` is an unbound read; `{X = 4, X = 3}`
  is legal and fails at run time.
- Definitions on the RHS of `andalso`/`orelse` or inside `catch Expr` are unsafe
  afterwards (OTP `vtunsafe`); names bound before a `catch` stay usable. Every
  name bound inside a `try` is unsafe afterwards; `of` clauses see the body's
  names, catch clauses see them as unsafe, and the after body sees every name
  bound earlier in the try as unsafe. A catch clause's stack variable must be
  new (OTP `stacktrace_bound`) and its guard must not read it
  (`stacktrace_guard`). A `maybe` exports nothing: each `?=` binds for the
  following body expressions, `else` clauses see the body's names as unsafe
  and every name bound inside is unsafe afterwards. Guards never publish
  bindings; matches in guards are errors even when unreachable.
- Map keys read only incoming bindings; binary sizes also read earlier segments
  of the same binary (see [patterns](patterns.md#scopes)).
- A `case` scrutinee binds in the enclosing scope. Each clause starts from that
  scope; its pattern definitions are tentative until the guard, which only
  reads. Names bound by every clause are exported with one identity (later
  clauses reuse the identity an earlier clause gave the name); names bound by
  only some clauses, or unsafe in any, are unsafe afterwards. Exports join
  conservatively like OTP's `erl_lint` (`icrt_export`); OTP's warning when a
  later pattern matches an exported name is not emitted. `if` clauses follow
  the same rules with a guard and no pattern.
- `begin`/`end` is a sequence in the enclosing scope.
- Unbound, unsafe and wildcard reads are located errors. Messages keep the
  compiler's wording (`unbound variable X`, `unsafe variable X`); the bindings
  corpus checks each against OTP's `unbound_var`/`unsafe_var` class.
- A comprehension evaluates each qualifier in order in the scope left by the
  previous ones. Generator patterns bind new names that shadow outer ones
  (reads inside the pattern prefer names it already bound); a zip group binds
  all its patterns together. Templates read like siblings. The scope after the
  comprehension is the one before it: its names are unbound there.
- An anonymous fun's clauses each start from the scope at the fun: head
  names are new and shadow outer ones, guards read them, and nothing bound
  inside is visible after the fun. Every outer definition read inside is
  recorded as a capture (`Function::captures`, definition order). A named
  fun's name is one more definition every clause starts with
  (`Function::fun_names`); it is never captured. The variables of
  `fun M:F/A` are reads of the fun expression (`Function::fun_operands`).

Walks are iterative with a module budget of 1,000,000 work units. Exhaustion or
any semantic error clears the module's binding and normalization tables.

## Types and specifications

A private type graph represents all parsed type forms independently of runtime
layout: singletons, ranges, containers, map field roles, function products and
unresolved applications. Unions flatten and deduplicate; `term()` is top and
`none()` bottom. Defaults: 16,384 nodes, 16 union members, 100,000 work items per
translation. Exhaustion widens to `term()` with a visible flag and never narrows
a representation.

Declared metadata (`-type`, `-opaque`, `-nominal`, `-export_type`, `-spec`,
`-callback`, `-optional_callbacks`) follows the OTP typespec reference and
pinned `erl_lint`/`erl_internal`/`erl_types` behavior:

- Local aliases may shadow builtin type names. Remote batch types must be
  exported. Missing types, duplicates, malformed metadata, singleton type
  variables, invalid bounds and specs for missing functions are errors.
  Unavailable external types warn and become `term()`.
- Each alias or overload has its own variable scope; repeated formals follow
  OTP's last-argument substitution.
- Recursive aliases stay finite named references; opaque bodies expand only in
  their module; nominal names are kept everywhere, and only the
  specification check reads a nominal type's definition, inside its module.
- Constant evaluation is exact, limited to 10,000 decimal digits per value.

## Inference

Inference is separate from declared types and never trusts specs.

- Exported inputs, and inputs of functions that `fun F/A` names, are
  arbitrary terms. A function entered only by direct calls of the batch
  (neither exported nor named by a fun) takes the join of its call sites'
  argument facts as inputs (step 58F, `semantic/types/inference_inputs`),
  matched by each clause's head patterns; recursive calls count too. Inputs
  start at `none()` (a function nothing calls never runs and infers
  `none()`) and grow over passes of the batch: 8 passes join, later ones
  widen like recursive results; inputs that have not settled after 16 passes
  become `term()` (reported as widened).
- Literals have exact facts (step 58B):
  integers of any size and characters are singletons, atoms singleton atoms,
  floats `float()`, strings nonempty lists of their characters (`[]` for
  `""`), and `-`/`+` of a literal number keep its fact. Tuples keep their
  elements' facts; maps built with constant keys (a fact of one value: an
  integer, an atom, `[]`, or a tuple or map of such) keep each key's value
  fact, a key given twice keeping its last value, and any other key makes
  `map()`. A bitstring construction counts its size: literal, sized and
  UTF-encoded literal characters exactly, a UTF segment of another value by
  its encoding (UTF-8: 8 to 32 bits by bytes), and a `binary`/`bitstring`
  segment by its value's fact or any multiple of its unit
  (`<<1, Rest/binary>>` is `nonempty_binary()`). An operand that never
  produces a value (`none()`) makes the construction `none()`.
- Operators and builtins (step 58C, `semantic/types/inference_operators`)
  compute their result from their operands' facts. Integer singletons fold
  exactly up to 4,096 bits per operand and result (bignums included; a larger one is
  `integer()`); other integers use interval arithmetic for `+`, `-`, `*` of
  nonnegative ranges, `band` with a nonnegative operand (`X band 15` is
  `0..15`), `rem` by a bounded divisor (`X rem 10` is `-9..9`), `bnot`,
  unary `-` and `abs/1`; a float operand makes `float()`, an unknown one
  `number()`, and `/` is always `float()`. Comparisons fold when the operands'
  values can only compare one way (singleton atoms or integers, disjoint
  integer ranges, numbers against non-numbers) and are `boolean()` otherwise;
  `and`/`or`/`xor`/`not` and `andalso`/`orelse` combine the truth values their
  operands can have (the right operand of `andalso` is the result when the
  left one is `true`). A table gives each bridge builtin its result: `pid()`
  for `self/0` and `spawn/1,3`, `reference()`, `port()`,
  `non_neg_integer()` for sizes, `string()`, `nonempty_string()`,
  `binary()`, `list()`, `tuple()`, `atom()`, `boolean()` for type tests,
  `true`/`ok` for side-effect builtins, the message for `!` and `send/2`;
  `trunc/1` and friends keep integer operands; unknown builtins are
  `term()`. An operation that always raises (`1 + a`, `1 div 0`, `error/1`,
  `exit/1`, `throw/1`, `halt/0,1`) is `none()`, and `erlang:raise/3` returns
  only `badarg`. Folding never changes the generated code: overflow and
  failures stay runtime outcomes.
- A body whose expression never completes (`none()`) is `none()`; so is a call
  with such an argument. Raising paths add nothing to a join, so a function
  that always raises infers `none()`.
- Identity/projection functions keep exact argument relations, propagated
  through nested local and remote calls with fresh variables per call.
- Containers (step 58D, `semantic/types/inference_containers`): a list
  `[E1, ..., En | T]` joins its elements in front of the tail's fact (a
  proper list when the tail is one, `nonempty_improper_list(H, T)` when it
  is no list, `nonempty_maybe_improper_list()` when it is unknown or may be
  improper: a cell is never empty, also in a pattern such as `[H | _]`); `++`, `--`, `hd/1`, `tl/1`,
  `element/2`, `setelement/3`, `tuple_to_list/1` and `map_get/2` read and
  rebuild element facts member by member of a union, a member that would
  raise adding nothing. A map update keeps exact keys (`:=` of a missing key
  drops that member) and makes `map()` of an unknown map. Tuple records are
  tuples: construction fills defaults (`undefined` without one), access and
  update read and set the field of the matching tuples, and `#r.f` is the
  field's index. A list comprehension is a possibly empty list of its
  templates' facts, a binary comprehension any number of copies of its
  template's size, a map comprehension `map()`.
- Funs (step 58E, `semantic/types/inference_funs`): `fun F/A` is a fun of
  its arity returning the function's inferred result (a builtin's, or with a
  variable arity, `fun()`), `fun M:F/A` one returning `term()`, and an
  anonymous fun one returning its clauses' joined results, captured values
  included. A call of a value joins the results of its funs of that arity
  that its arguments select (step 58L; `term()` for an unknown fun, `none()`
  when no member can be called so).
  An anonymous fun bound whole to a variable and called through it is
  evaluated again for that call with its patterns matching the arguments'
  facts, at most 4 such calls deep, and its first evaluation's facts are
  restored afterwards (`Double = fun(Y) -> Y * 2 end, Double(3)` is 6).
  `apply(F, Args)` (also `erlang:apply/2`) is a call of `F` with the
  arguments `Args` holds: the elements of a literal proper list, else those
  of its fact (`[]`, a list of known positions, or as many copies of a
  proper list's element as `F`'s single arity takes); a bound anonymous fun
  is evaluated again as above (`apply(fun kind/1, [1])` selects `kind(1)`).
  `apply(M, F, Args)` whose `M` and `F` are known atoms naming an exported
  batch function reads that function's function types like `fun F/A`.
  Arguments of unknown length, other targets and `M:F(Args)` with variable
  names stay `term()`. Since `fun F/A` and `apply/3` may name a function
  inferred later, the passes over the batch also repeat until every such
  read saw its function's final result; otherwise a last pass gives them
  `term()` results.
- Whole-value body assignments and aliases copy the RHS fact
  (`Y = 42, Z = Y, id(Z)` infers 42); tuple, list, map and tuple-record
  patterns give their variables the facts of the parts they match, in body
  matches, `case` clauses (from the scrutinee), a `try`'s `of` clauses (from
  its body's value) and generators (from their input's elements or map keys
  and values). Unproved values stay `term()` without relations.
- Narrowing (step 58G, `semantic/types/inference_narrowing`,
  `inference_scopes`, `meet`): inside a function, `case`, `receive` or fun
  clause, each pattern meets the value it matches (a literal, tuple, list,
  tuple-record, map or bitstring shape; a bound variable's fact), a
  `case` scrutinee variable narrows with it, and the guard narrows the
  variables it tests. Type tests (`is_atom/1` to `atom()`, `is_boolean/1`,
  `is_integer/1`, `is_float/1`, `is_number/1`, `is_binary/1`,
  `is_bitstring/1`, `is_list/1` to `maybe_improper_list()`, `is_tuple/1`,
  `is_map/1`, `is_function/1,2`, `is_pid/1`, `is_port/1`, `is_reference/1`,
  `is_record/2,3` to the record's tuple, `is_map_key/2` its map to `map()`,
  and the old guard names) meet their argument's fact; comparisons with
  integer constants (`<`, `=<`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `=:=`, either side, folded
  constants included) narrow a value already proven to be an integer to a
  range, the bounds of one test accumulating (`10 >= X, X >= 0` is `0..10`);
  two proven integers compared narrow each other by their bounds (`X > Y`
  with `Y` in `0..5` makes `X` at least 1), and `/=`, `=/=` with a constant
  move a range bound equal to it inward (step 58H1). A value that may be a
  float or another term is not narrowed. A conjunction applies
  each test in turn, a disjunction joins what each alternative proves, `not`
  and false tests prove nothing. A clause after one whose patterns are all
  plain variables and whose whole guard was a single type test sees that
  value without the tested category; after a single comparison with an
  integer constant, the same value (a plain variable of this clause) proven
  to be an integer sees the comparison false (`f(N) when N >= 0 -> ...;
  f(N) when is_integer(N) -> ...`: the second clause sees `neg_integer()`). The right operand of `andalso`, the
  `true` clause of `case Test of`, and what follows a comprehension filter
  see the test as true. An empty meet makes the clause impossible: it adds
  nothing to the result. Narrowed facts hold only inside their clause or
  operand; `catch`, the right operand of `orelse` and every clause restore
  the facts from before them. After a `case`, `if`, `receive`, `try` or
  `maybe`, a variable's fact is the join of its facts at the end of each
  clause that completes (step 58H), so `case X of forever -> ...; N when
  is_integer(N), N >= 0 -> ... end` leaves `X` as
  `non_neg_integer() | forever`.
- `try` and `maybe` (step 58J1): a `try` is the join of its `of` clauses'
  values (its body's without `of`) and its catch clauses' values; the
  `after` body adds nothing. `of` clauses start from the facts at the end of
  the body and match its value like `case` clauses (an impossible clause
  adds nothing); catch clauses and the `after` body start from the facts
  before the `try`, a class pattern matching `error | exit | throw`. A
  `maybe` is the join of its body's value, its `else` clauses' values and,
  without `else`, the values its `?=` matches can fail on: the matched
  value's fact without the pattern's shape when the pattern matches all of
  its shape (new variables used once, literal atoms and integers, `[]`,
  tuples of them), else the whole fact. Each `?=` pattern meets its value
  and publishes its variables for the rest of the body; a `?=` that can
  never match stops the body. `else` clauses start from the facts before the
  `maybe` and match the joined failing values like `case` clauses. The facts
  after a `try` join those at the end of its body (without `of`) and of
  each completing clause; after a `maybe`, those at the end of its body, of
  each completing `else` clause and, without `else`, those before it.
- Uses (step 58H, `semantic/types/inference_uses`): an operation that raises
  unless an operand has a type proves that type for the variable it read,
  after the operation returns: arithmetic and unary `-`/`+` a `number()`,
  `div`, `rem`, bit operators and `bnot` an `integer()`, `and`/`or`/`xor`,
  `not` and the left operand of `andalso`/`orelse` a `boolean()`, `++` and
  `--` a `list()`, a called value a fun of that arity, a variable module or
  function name an `atom()`, a map update `map()`, a tuple-record access or
  update the record's tuple, a binary segment its type (`<<X:8>>`:
  `integer()`) and its size a `non_neg_integer()`, and one row per bridge
  builtin argument check (`hd/1`, `tl/1` `nonempty_maybe_improper_list()`,
  `length/1` `list()`, `element/2` `pos_integer()` and `tuple()`,
  `map_get/2` and `is_map_key/2` `map()`, `atom_to_list/1` `atom()`, ...).
  The operation keeps its runtime check. Names bound to the same value
  (`Y = X`, a variable `case` pattern on a variable scrutinee) narrow
  together.
- Entry and success domains: each argument's entry domain is the join over
  the possible function clauses of its fact after the head and guard (a
  plain variable's narrowed fact, else the pattern's); its success domain
  (step 58H) the join over the clauses that complete of its fact at their
  normal return. `--print-types` shows the success domain as the inputs
  (`bounded(1..10) -> 1..10`, `inc(X) -> X + 1` as
  `inc(number()) -> number()`), or the entry domain of a function that never
  returns. A call that returns narrows its variable arguments to the
  callee's domain, except within a recursive component still being solved.
- Clause results join conservatively: a projection survives only if every
  clause returns the same argument. A `case` or `if` joins its clause results
  the same way; a binding defined by several of its clauses stays `term()`.
- Function types (step 58K, `semantic/types/function_types`): beside the
  union summary above, a function keeps one function type per possible
  clause, like the overloads of a `-spec`: the arguments' facts after the
  head and guard (a plain variable's narrowed fact, else the pattern's) and
  the clause's result (`none()` for a clause that always raises; impossible
  clauses add none). A clause whose result is a
  [dependent fact](#dependent-facts) on its arguments (a `case` or `if`
  ending it, or a variable bound to one, nested at any depth) splits into one
  function type per clause of that fact, its parameters' facts met with the
  arguments they name. Function types of equal inputs merge
  (their results join); past 32 the last ones merge into one, inputs and
  results joined. Recursive components iterate them with the results, each
  round joining (then widening) each type's result; a component that does
  not converge keeps only its union summaries. An anonymous fun's fact keeps
  one function type per possible clause (its patterns and guard over any
  argument), `fun F/A` the function types of `F/A`; funs that join keep their
  function types only when they are equal, otherwise they join as one fun of
  their joined results with any inputs (meeting a fun of any inputs, as the
  use `F(A)` does, keeps them). Specialization, domains and specification
  checks read the union summary.
- Calls select function types (step 58L): a call of a function with
  function types reads, in order, each type whose inputs every argument fact
  meets, and stops after an exact one (patterns of new variables used once,
  literal atoms and integers, `[]` and tuples of them; no guard or only
  `true` and type tests of plain argument variables; for a branch, an
  argument as the `case` scrutinee) whose inputs hold the arguments: no
  later clause can be entered. Its result is the join of the selected
  types' results, a result equal to an argument being that argument's fact
  within the type's result; none selected makes the call `none()` (it can
  only raise `function_clause`). Unknown arguments select every type, the
  union; a function without function types (budget, unconverged component)
  uses its union summary. After a call returns, its variable arguments
  narrow to the success domain and to the selected types' joined inputs.
  Calls of fun values select the fun fact's function types the same way,
  and an anonymous fun evaluated again for a call (see Funs) enters, guards
  and leaves its clauses like a `case`, so a clause its arguments cannot
  match adds nothing (`F = fun(1) -> one; (_) -> other end, F(2)` is
  `other`). Recursive components converge on results and function types.
- Calls evaluate their callee again (step 58M): when a call's argument facts
  are within the callee's inputs and narrower in one, the callee's body is
  evaluated again with them as its inputs, like a bound anonymous fun, and
  the call's result is the selected function types' result met with that
  evaluation's (`two_callers() -> {add_one(10), add_one(20)}` is
  `{11, 21}`); the call's arguments also narrow to that evaluation's success
  domain. The callee's summary, function types and recorded expression
  facts never change (specialization reads only those). Budgets: 4 nested
  evaluations, callees of at most 256 expressions, 4,096 work units per call
  from a pool of 262,144 per pass over the batch (separate from the batch's
  own budget); recursive components are never evaluated again. Past a
  budget the call keeps the selected function types' result.
- A `receive` is the join of its clauses and its `after` body, which a
  timeout of `infinity` never runs.
- A recursive component starts every member's result at `none()` and re-infers
  all members until no result changes; each round joins the new result with the
  previous one (widens it after the first 8 rounds,
  [inference domain](#inference-domain)), and a pending recursive call adds
  nothing to a join. A function that can never return stays `none()`. A
  component that has not converged after 8 rounds plus 4 per member widens
  every member to `term()` (reported as widened, like budget exhaustion) and a
  final round recomputes the expression facts; earlier rounds' expression
  facts are discarded, so only facts from the final assumptions remain.
- A shared work budget bounds inference; exhaustion loses precision and falls
  back to generic code, never rejects a program.
- Specifications that contradict inference are errors (step 58I,
  `semantic/types/contracts`). A declared type becomes the facts it holds (or
  more): built-in types by name (`byte()` is `0..255`, `timeout()` is
  `non_neg_integer() | infinity`, `iodata()` and `iolist()` lists of any
  shape), aliases by their definition, opaque and nominal types by their
  definition inside their module and as any term outside it, remote types
  through the batch, type variables through their `when` bounds (an
  unconstrained one is any term), maps and records by their category. A
  specification contradicts the code when its facts share no value with what
  inference proves: the inferred result (unless unknown, or `none()`: a
  function that never returns fits any result), an argument's entry domain,
  or a call's argument facts against every overload. `none()`/`no_return()`
  admits only a function that never returns. The error names the function,
  the declared type as written and the inferred one. Because inferred facts
  may hold more values than the code produces, only a disjoint pair is a
  contradiction: a declared type narrower than the inferred one is
  accepted. `-callback` specifications are not checked. OTP's compiler does
  not check specifications ([differences](differences.md#language-edge-cases)).

### Dependent facts

Steps 58N1–58N3 (`semantic/types/dependent`). A `case`, `if` or
`try ... of` behaves like a fun of the variables its clauses narrow, applied
to them: its value is a dependent fact, one function type per possible
clause.

- Parameters: the variables bound before the construct that its scrutinee
  (a `try`'s body's last expression) and guards read, in source order
  (variables its clause patterns bind are new in each clause, not
  parameters); at most 4, a later one's narrowing is forgotten. Each
  possible clause keeps the parameters' facts after its pattern and guard
  and its value (`none()` for a clause that never completes); it is exact,
  like a function type (58L), when a `case` or `try` matches a parameter or
  a tuple of parameters with an exact pattern and guard, or an `if` has an
  exact guard.
- A scrutinee that is a tuple of variables narrows each variable to its
  element of the matched value, and a tuple pattern's variable is bound to
  the same value as the scrutinee's element at its position
  (`case {X, Y} of {A, b} when is_integer(A) -> ...` narrows `X` and `Y`).
- A `try ... of` depends on its `of` clauses; its catch clauses can follow
  any value of its body, so their joined values join into every clause's
  value (`try X of 1 -> one; _ -> other catch _:_ -> error end` is
  `$try_of_operator(X :: 1) -> error | one; (X :: _) -> error | other`).
- `receive` and `maybe ... else` stay the join of their clauses: their
  clauses match a message or a failed `?=` value that nothing outside them
  can name, so no read could select among them.
- A clause whose value is itself dependent (a nested `case` or `if`, or a
  read of a dependent variable) contributes one function type per clause of
  it over the union of both parameter lists, inputs met. Types that can
  never be entered (an input `none()`, or within an earlier exact type's
  inputs) are dropped, so are parameters whose facts are the same in every
  type; equal inputs merge and past 32 types the last ones merge (58K). A
  construct whose remaining types all give the same value, or that narrows
  no parameter, is its plain join.
- Every other consumer reads the erased fact, the join of the clauses'
  values. Facts that leave the walked function (results, function types,
  fun facts) are erased; joins keep a dependence only when both sides have
  the same one.
- A variable bound to a dependent value keeps it. Reading the variable
  selects the clauses its parameters' current facts enter (58L order, an
  exact clause whose inputs hold them stops) and whose values meet the
  variable's own narrowed fact, and the read's fact is the join of their
  values (`Y = case X of 1 -> one; _ -> other end, case X of 1 -> Y end`
  reads `one`).
- A variable every clause of a `case` or `if` binds (step 58N2) is the join
  of its facts at the end of the clauses that complete, dependent on the
  construct's parameters like its value:
  `case X of 1 -> Y = 5; _ -> Y = 6 end, Y` infers `(1) -> 5; (_) -> 6`.
  The same join applies after `receive`, `try` and `maybe`, without
  dependence.
- Operators, builtins, tuple, list, map and record constructions, and calls
  of batch functions (their function types selected as in 58L, the
  arguments not narrowed again) with dependent operands are evaluated once
  per combination of the operands' clauses, with those clauses' values in
  place of the operands' facts and their inputs met (step 58N2): reads of
  one variable take the same clause, other operands combine, at most 16
  combinations (past that the use is the plain join). `R + 1` with
  `R = case X of a -> 1; b -> 2 end` infers `(a) -> 2; (b) -> 3`.
- Narrowing a dependent variable (a pattern, a guard, a use) also narrows
  its parameters to the join of the inputs of the clauses entered whose
  values meet the narrowed fact, and their parameters in turn, 4 levels
  deep: after `R = case X of a -> 1; b -> 2 end`, `case R of 1 -> X end`
  reads `X` as `a`.
- A function clause's dependent result splits it (see Function types):
  parameters that name an argument, or a name bound to its value, meet its
  input; others are dropped (such a type is exact only if their input is any
  term). `nested_case(X, L)` with `case X of 1 -> case L of spanish -> uno;
  _ -> one end; _ -> other end` infers `(1, spanish) -> uno; (1, _) -> one;
  (_, _) -> other`.
- `--print-types` notes a dependent value as a function type named by
  its construct, each input after its parameter's name:
  `case X of 1 -> one; _ -> other end` ends in
  `end. % $case_of_operator(X :: 1) -> one; (X :: _) -> other`; an `if`
  prints `$if_operator`, a `try ... of` `$try_of_operator`.

### Inference domain

Decision of plan 11 step 58A (`semantic/types/lattice`). A fact is a set of
values a variable or result can have. Facts join where control flow meets
(clauses, branches) and widen between the rounds of a recursive component;
every budget below widens soundly to a larger set, never rejects a program.
Facts print as Erlang types, categories by their built-in names.

| Fact | Printed | Join | Budget and widening |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nothing | `none()` | Identity | A function that never returns stays `none()` |
| Anything | `term()` | Absorbs every fact | `dynamic()` and `any()` are `term()` |
| Integers | `42`, `1 \| 3 \| 7` | Union of singletons | More than 8 singletons become their range |
| Integer range | `1..10`, `0..255` | Smallest range holding both | A bound that moved between rounds goes to the next threshold: a lower one to 1, then 0, then unbounded; an upper one to -1, then unbounded |
| Unbounded integers | `pos_integer()` (1 and up), `non_neg_integer()` (0 and up), `neg_integer()` (-1 and down), `integer()` | Smallest interval holding both, printed by its category | — |
| Floats | `float()` | — | — |
| Numbers | `number()` | A range or category of integers joined with `float()` | Singleton integers with `float()` stay `1 \| float()` |
| Atoms | `ok`, `error \| ok`, `boolean()` | Union of singletons; exactly `false` and `true` print `boolean()` | More than 8 singletons become `atom()` |
| Identifiers | `pid()`, `port()`, `reference()` | — | — |
| Tuples | `{ok, 1}`, `tuple()`, `#point{x :: 0, y :: _}` | Tuples of the same size whose first elements are not two different atoms (their tag) join element by element; others stay separate members | More than 16 elements become `tuple()` unless every element is known; more than 8 separate shapes become `tuple()`. A tuple of a visible tuple record's name and size prints as the record (step 58J) |
| Lists | `[]`, `[T]`, `[T, ...]`, `nonempty_improper_list(H, T)`, `[1, a]`, `[a, b \| T]` | Elements join; `[]` with a nonempty list gives a possibly empty one; improper lists join heads and tails. Lists of two or more known elements keep their positions (step 58J; a Clause notation, the type language has none, elements printed with `\|` in parentheses): positional lists of one length join position by position, otherwise they join as plain lists | A list of `0..1114111` (`char()`) prints `string()` or `nonempty_string()`; a possibly empty list of `_` prints `list()` |
| Maps | `#{}`, `#{a := 1}`, `#{1..17 => a}`, `map()` | Maps with the same keys join value by value; maps of other keys join into one association of their joined keys and values (`=>`: any key may be missing, step 58J) | More than 16 keys join into one association |
| Funs | `fun((term()) -> 1)`, `fun()` | Funs of one arity join their results; other arities give `fun()` | — |
| Bitstrings | `<<_:16>>`, `<<_:3, _:_*2>>`, `binary()` | The shorter size plus every difference of sizes as a unit | Base and unit 0/8, 8/8, 0/1, 1/1 print `binary()`, `nonempty_binary()`, `bitstring()`, `nonempty_bitstring()` |

- A union keeps one member per joined shape, in Erlang term order of their
  values: numbers, atoms, `reference()`, funs, `port()`, `pid()`, tuples, maps,
  `[]`, lists, bitstrings, then declared named types; more than 8 members
  become `term()`.
- Containers nest at most 4 levels; a fact deeper inside becomes `term()`.
- A recursive component joins results for 8 rounds (cycles of up to 8
  functions converge exactly), then widens them. A component that has not
  converged after 4 further rounds per member widens every member to `term()`
  and is reported as widened, like an exhausted budget.
- Narrowing (plan steps 58G, 58H, `Lattice::meet`) is the meet of facts, the
  values both hold (or more, but `none()` only when they share none):
  patterns and guards (type tests such as `is_integer/1` narrow their argument
  to the category) narrow within their clause and set a function's entry
  domain; a use that raises unless its operand has a type narrows the operand
  after it on the normal path. An empty meet means the path cannot run.
- Specifications never add to facts: inferred facts come only from code and
  never decide a representation on a spec's word.

Lowering consumes these facts. At `-O2` with type specialization, facts of
caller-joined arguments and of expressions remove tag, shape and service checks
([proofs](specialization.md#proofs)); the only heap pointer conversions are
those proven reads. Each fallible service result is loaded only on its success
path, and shape checks dominate extraction. Specialization policy:
[specialization.md](specialization.md).

## `--print-types`

Prints each module of the batch (input/target order, library modules after
them) as Erlang source ([source printing](compile.md#source-printing)) with what
type inference found. Output is on stdout and is human-readable, not Erlang and
not an interchange format. Warnings stay on stderr.

```erlang
%% module "branches" source="branches.erl" target="" declared=complete inferred=complete
-module(branches).
-export([mixed/1]).

%% inferred: mixed(1) -> 1; (_) -> 2
mixed(X) ->
    case X of
        1 ->
            1;
        _ ->
            2
    end. % $case_of_operator(X :: 1) -> 1; (X :: _) -> 2
```

- A `%% module` line names the module, its source, the project target and
  whether declared and inferred types completed or were widened by a limit.
- Declarations (`-type`, `-spec`, `-callback`, records) appear as written.
- Above each function, `%% declared: f(Inputs) -> Result` gives each overload
  of its `-spec` as resolved (with its `when` constraints), and
  `%% inferred: f(Inputs) -> Result` what inference found, so the two can be
  compared. The inputs are each argument's success domain (from `term()`
  for exported functions and those `fun F/A` names, from the callers'
  joined arguments for other functions). A function with several function
  types prints one signature per type, each with its own inputs:
  `f(integer()) -> integer(); (atom()) -> string()`
  (`semantic::types::function_source`). A `-spec` stays with the function right after
  it, set apart from other forms by a blank line.
- Each line's outermost expression (a body expression, or a `case`'s
  scrutinee) whose fact says more than `term()` is noted with a trailing
  `% Type` comment after the line's punctuation (a known type hides an
  argument relation, which shows only for a value known as nothing else):
  at most one note per line, none for the expressions nested in it, so the
  output stays valid Erlang. A body expression on several lines carries its
  note on its last line (`end, % ...`). Literal terms (literals, and tuples,
  lists, constructed maps and bitstrings of literals) are not noted; a match
  shows its value. A dependent value prints like a function type of its
  construct ([dependent facts](#dependent-facts)).
- A value inference proved equal to one of the function's arguments, and known
  as nothing more, prints as that argument's name, a type variable: the
  variable the first clause binding the whole argument gives it, else
  `_argumentN` (1-based, also when an earlier argument took the name). The
  argument's input shows the same name when it is any term:
  `second(_, Y) -> Y`, `keep(Acc, number()) -> Acc`. A variable shows only
  its type, its name already says which argument it is.

### Inference expectations

`tests/fixtures/inference/*.erl` record what inference should find for each
function, and what it finds today. Each module becomes the CTest
`inference_<module>` (`tests/compiler/inference/expectations.py`):

```erlang
%% expect: sum() -> 3
%% today: sum() -> _
sum() -> 1 + 2.
```

- `expect:` is the signature `--print-types` should print in its
  `%% inferred:` line; `today:`, present while inference falls short, is the
  one it prints now.
- The check compares the output with `today` when there is one, else with
  `expect`; every function of the module needs an `expect` line. A `today`
  line that inference has caught up with fails the check until it is removed.
- `expectations.py <clau> <fixture> --record` rewrites the `today`
  lines from the current output (a maintainer action: review the diff).
- `values.erl` covers literals, arithmetic and comparisons, calls of local and
  other functions, integer joins and ranges, integers or floats, lists,
  strings, tuples, maps with atom and other keys, funs returned and applied,
  binaries, argument relations and `try`/`maybe` values. Today inference finds literal and
  constructed values, operator and builtin results, containers and their
  parts, funs and their calls, local inputs from callers, integer joins and
  argument relations, narrowing by uses and success domains (141 of 141
  functions).
- `narrowing.erl` covers each type test, case guards, true-test scrutinees,
  `andalso`, comprehension filters, tuple/list/map patterns, catch-all
  clauses, range guards, contradictions, disjunctions, the clause after a
  single type test, narrowing after a call, narrowings that must not leak,
  and comparison ranges: each operator either side, two variables, `=/=` at
  and inside a bound, complements, case and if guards, an `orelse`, a
  guarded countdown, and operands that must not narrow (51 of 51).
- `base_types.erl` has a function per base and built-in type of the
  [type language](https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/typespec.html) (`pid()`,
  `reference()`, bitstrings and binaries, ranges, `byte()`, `char()`,
  `non_neg_integer()`, `boolean()`, `string()`, `iolist()`, `mfa()`,
  `timeout()`, `no_return()`, ...): its `-spec` names the type, so every
  built-in type is checked to resolve, and its body produces such a value.
  Categories are expected under their built-in names, bounded integer sets as
  ranges. Every function reaches its expected type.
- `clauses.erl` covers function types (step 58K): type tests and literal
  patterns per clause, merged equal inputs, a clause callers never enter,
  more clauses than the budget, a recursive function, a single clause, a
  `case` and an `if` ending the body, a nested `case` and a `case` that is
  not last, multi-clause anonymous funs, `fun F/A`, joins of equal and of
  different funs, and a clause that always raises; and call selection (step
  58L): a type test, a first exact branch, unknown arguments, no admitted
  type, narrowing after the call, a literal argument, a range over two
  clauses, nested calls, a local with several callers, a recursive callee,
  and multi-clause funs bound, in a tuple, passed to a local and called with
  an unknown argument; and evaluation per call (step 58M): per-call
  results, nesting up to and past the depth budget, a callee past the size
  budget, a recursive callee and unknown arguments.

### Printing types

`semantic::types::type_source(graph, type)` (`semantic/types/printing`) renders
a type of the type graph in Erlang type syntax: `_` for any term (`term()`,
written by `TERM_SOURCE` for brevity; type syntax reads `_` as `any()`), `none()`, atoms and
integers, `1..5`, `{ok, T}`, `tuple()`, `[T]`, `[T, ...]`, `#{K => V, K := V}`,
`#r{f :: T}`, `<<_:B, _:_*U>>`, `fun((A) -> R)`, `A | B`. A fun of several
function types prints them in a Clause notation, `fun((1) -> one; (_) ->
other)`: Erlang type syntax has no overloaded fun type, and a union of fun
types means something else. A union's integers
print in value order where its first integer stands, consecutive ones as a
range (`1 | 2 | 3 | 5` prints `1..3 | 5`; the fact keeps the singletons).
Predefined `erlang`
types drop their module; references to declared types stay named. A budget of
nodes bounds the text; past it, and below 32 levels of nesting, `...` stands in.

```sh
clau --print-types answer.erl client.erl
clau --print-types --project project.toml --target demo --verbose
```
