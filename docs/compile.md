# Compilation

`clau` compiles Erlang/OTP 29 modules through LLVM to verified IR, bitcode
or native objects. `-o/--output` links positional inputs (or one selected
project target), their [entry](executables.md) startup object and the runtime
into an executable ([linking](executables.md#linking)); project builds link
executable targets to their manifest outputs ([projects](projects.md#executables)). Emitted
objects can also run through a C++ harness linked with the runtime (see the
example below).

## Accepted source subset

Named modules with exports and ordered function clauses. Heads and body matches
accept variables, `_`, aliases, repeated names and patterns over atoms,
arbitrary integers, finite floats, tuples, lists/strings, maps, bitstrings and
ordinary tuple records. Bodies are sequences of matches, constructors, checked
operators/guard BIFs, `erlang:display/1` ([printing](terms.md#printing)),
`halt/0,1` ([exit status](executables.md#exit-status)), the raising
`error/1,2,3`, `exit/1`, `throw/1` and `erlang:raise/3`
([ABI](abi.md#failure-channel-revision-2)), the other
[bridge builtins](builtins.md) (`erlang:function_exported/3`) and funs of
builtins, `case`/`if`, `catch Expr`,
`try ... of ... catch Class:Reason:Stack ... after` with
[stack traces](abi.md#stack-traces), `maybe ... else ... end`, list, binary and map comprehensions
([patterns](patterns.md#comprehensions)) and direct local or
literal remote calls within the batch, including self, mutual and cross-module
recursion on explicit process frames with proper tail calls
([execution model](execution-model.md#implementation)); body recursion is bounded
by the process stack (uncapped by default), not the native stack. Guards support the full admitted
catalog. See [patterns](patterns.md), [guards](guards.md) and [terms](terms.md).

Function values `fun F/A`, `fun M:F/A`, anonymous and named funs with
captured variables, calls of funs and dynamic calls (`M:F(...)`, `apply/2,3`)
run ([funs](funs.md)). Rejected with diagnostics even in unused functions:
`receive`, funs of builtins,
processes and messaging.
Accepted attributes: `module`, `export`, `file`, tuple and native `record`,
`export_record`, `import_record`, type/spec
forms, `doc`/`moduledoc`, `behaviour`/`behavior` ([behaviours](semantic.md#behaviours)),
any informational attribute (`vsn`, `author`, `copyright`, `deprecated`,
`dialyzer`, user-defined `-name(Term)`; kept for
[`module_info(attributes)`](semantic.md#predefined-functions)),
`-import(Module, [F/A, ...])` ([imports](semantic.md#imports)) and `-compile`
with options that change nothing Clause emits: `{no_auto_import, ...}`, warning
options (`nowarn_*`, `warn_*`, `{nowarn_unused_function, [...]}`) and
optimization, debug and reporting hints (`inline`, `{inline, [F/A]}`,
`{inline_size, N}`, `{inline_effort, N}`, `inline_list_funcs`, `debug_info`,
`deterministic`, `report*`, `verbose`, ...). `{parse_transform, Module}` runs
the transform on the host Erlang/OTP before analysis
([parse transforms](transforms.md)). `on_load`, `nifs`, `export_all`, other `compile`
options and parameterized modules are rejected; the diagnostic names them, for example
`[behavior-changing attributes] notimpl [module="m" operation="-compile option export_all"]`.
Every module gets `module_info/0,1`.
Sources starting with `#!` follow [escript rules](executables.md#escripts)
(implicit module and `main/1` export, `-mode` accepted).
Type/spec forms are analyzed but never change generated code. Syntax-only modes
(`--parse-check`, `--print-ast`, `--print-source`, ...) accept the full grammar.

## Run the compiled-module example

`client:main/1` makes the example a program:

```sh
./build/debug/bin/clau -O2 -o build/demo examples/compile/answer.erl examples/compile/client.erl
./build/demo     # prints 42, -7 and {record,map,binary,list,integer,other}
```

The same modules also run through a C++ harness. From a Windows x64 Developer
PowerShell with the built compiler:

```powershell
$tool = './build/debug/bin/clau.exe'
& $tool -O0 --emit obj --artifact-dir build/example-aot examples/compile/answer.erl examples/compile/client.erl
cmake -S examples/compile -B build/example-native -G Ninja -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug "-DGENERATED_DIR:PATH=$((Resolve-Path build/example-aot).Path)"
cmake --build build/example-native
./build/example-native/bin/Debug/compiled_modules.exe
```

It prints `42`, `-7`, `record`, `map`, `binary`, `list`, `integer`, `other`, one
per line. The harness registers modules explicitly, creates a context and
decodes results; it is an example host, not a production entry point. On Unix
use `build/debug/bin/clau`, `clang++` and `-DGENERATED_DIR="$PWD/build/example-aot"`
(native runs there are not yet validated).

Other actions on the same sources:

```powershell
& $tool -O2 --emit llvm-ir --artifact-dir build/example-ir examples/compile/answer.erl examples/compile/client.erl
& $tool --print-types --verbose examples/compile/answer.erl examples/compile/client.erl
& $tool --print-ir --print-optimized-ir examples/compile/answer.erl examples/compile/client.erl
& $tool -O2 --no-type-specialization --verbose examples/compile/answer.erl examples/compile/client.erl
```

## Abstract format printing

`--print-abstr` (a frontend action) prints each parsed module as the OTP
[abstract format](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/absform.html) forms
`epp` would hand a parse transform, one `file:consult/1` term per line, the
same terms `erlc +to_abstr` writes ([transforms](transforms.md)).

## Source printing

`--print-source` (a frontend action, like `--print-ast`) prints each parsed
module as Erlang source; `--print-types` prints the same text with type
annotations. The printer (`print_source`, `expression_source`, `type_source`
in `printing.hpp`; `compiler/src/printing/source_*`) is reusable:

- Forms follow each other in source order, a blank line around each function;
  the `-file` form the preprocessor adds before a module is left out, those
  around included files are kept.
- The text is the parsed syntax: macros are expanded, includes inlined, and
  comments, original spelling and layout are gone. Clauses and block
  expressions (`case`, `if`, `receive`, `try`, `maybe`, `begin`, funs with
  more than one line) take indented lines of four columns; everything else is
  on one line. Parentheses come only from the source's own groups.
- Printed text parses back to the same syntax tree, and printing it again
  gives the same text (CTest `printing_source` over the parseable fixtures).
- `SourceNotes` adds a note to an expression, printed as a trailing
  `% Text` comment after the punctuation of the line where the expression
  ends, and comment lines above a form. Only whole-line expressions carry
  notes (body expressions and a `case`'s scrutinee; one per line, the
  outermost), so long nested expressions stay readable and the text stays
  Erlang. Patterns and guards carry none.

## Options

| Option | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `--emit obj\|llvm-ir\|llvm-bc` | Publish one artifact per module |
| `--artifact-dir DIR` | Artifact root (requires `--emit`) |
| `-o PATH` / `--output PATH` | Link an executable ([linking](executables.md#linking)); conflicts with `--emit` |
| `--linker PATH`, `--runtime-library PATH` | Clang driver and runtime archive for `-o` |
| `--entry MODULE[:FUNCTION]` | Executable entry function/1; validated in every compiling mode and adds the `clausev1_start` startup artifact ([executables](executables.md#startup-object)) |
| `--target-triple TRIPLE` | Target machine; `--target` is project target selection |
| `-O0` / `-O2` / `-Os` | Default generic code + LLVM O0 / bounded specialization + LLVM O2 / LLVM Os, no specialization, one section per symbol and linker dead-stripping of unreferenced code and data |
| `--no-type-specialization` | Disable variants regardless of option order |
| `--lto` | Link the modules as bitcode with LLD link-time optimization (Windows MSVC and ELF targets; needs `-o` or a linking project build) ([linking](executables.md#linking)) |
| `-g` | Erlang line tables in objects and linked executables (CodeView/PDB on MSVC targets, DWARF elsewhere) ([debugging](debugging.md)) |
| `--print-ir` / `--print-optimized-ir` | Verified IR before/after LLVM passes, with Erlang source lines as comments |
| `--print-types` | Each module as Erlang source annotated with inferred types ([semantic](semantic.md#--print-types)); stops before LLVM |
| `--verbose` | `[pp]`, `[parse]` and `[comp]` phase events on stderr |
| `--print-env` | Print the resolved compile environment as TOML on stdout and exit without processing sources ([environment report](#environment-report)) |
| `--print-inputs` | Preprocess and parse the inputs, add the modules they name as compilation does, then list every source of the batch on stdout and stop before compilation ([projects](projects.md#cli-and-target-selection)) |

- Without `--emit`, compilation verifies objects in memory and writes nothing.
- Positional inputs form one batch; each project target is its own batch.
- Artifact roots: `build/aot` (positional) or `build/aot/<hex-target>` under the
  manifest directory. Explicit roots are invocation-relative.
- Names are reversible hex: `answer` → `clausev1_616e73776572__0.obj` (`.o` for
  ELF/Mach-O, `.ll`, `.bc`); the startup object is `clausev1_start.obj`.
- All batches compile and stage before publication. Failures publish nothing
  and keep earlier outputs; replacement is atomic per file, not per batch.
- `--emit` conflicts with `-o`; compilation switches conflict with frontend-only
  actions and `--new-project`. `--print-types` rejects target/optimization options.
- IR snapshots are LLVM assembly; multiple snapshots are separated by escaped
  comment headers and are not one parseable module. Use `--emit llvm-ir` for
  tool input. Source-line comments show original text (unexpanded macros) and
  survive optimization through debug locations.

## Environment report

`--print-env` validates the whole command line (conflicts, readable positional
inputs, project planning), then prints what that command would use as one TOML
document on stdout, exits 0 and reads no source. Paths are absolute, with `/`.

```toml
# clau compile environment (--print-env)
command = ["clau", "--print-env", "-O2", "-o", "app", "main.erl"]  # as given
actions = ["link"]          # see below
working_directory = "/work"

[[targets]]                 # one per selected project target; one for positional inputs
name = "app"                # project targets only
project = "/work/project.toml"
sources = ["/work/src/main.erl"]           # globs and search paths resolved
library_directory = "/clau/library/stdlib" # searched after source_search_paths
entry = "main:main"         # or "auto" when linking without --entry
output = "/work/app"        # linking only: final name (".exe" on Windows)
linker = "/usr/bin/clang++" # linking only; "" when none is found
runtime_library = "/clau/lib/libclause_runtime.a"

[targets.options]           # manifest option names
source_search_paths = []    # directories, patterns expanded
include_dirs = []           # search order, patterns expanded
defines = []
applications = { "stdlib" = "/otp/lib/stdlib" }  # last mapping wins
enabled_features = ["maybe_expr"]                # OTP defaults plus changes

[targets.backend]
target_triple = "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"  # host when not given
optimization = "O2"
type_specialization = true  # O2 without --no-type-specialization
debug_info = false
lto = false
emit = "none"               # or obj, llvm-ir, llvm-bc
artifact_dir = "/work/build/aot"
```

(Arrays print one item per line.) `actions` lists the frontend actions
(`print-pp`, `parse-check`, `print-ast`, `print-source`, `print-abstr`, else
`preprocess-check`; `print-inputs` alone replaces them), else the inspections
(`print-types`, `print-ir`, `print-optimized-ir`), else `emit`, `link` (`-o`) or
`compile`. In a project build, targets with an `output` link too. Modules found
later by name (through `source_search_paths` or the library) are not listed:
finding them needs parsing (`--print-inputs` does that). `--print-env` cannot be combined with
`--new-project`.

## Backend

- One LLVM context and target machine per batch. Host triple uses host CPU and
  features; foreign triples use the generic CPU. PIC, small code model.
- Backends: X86, ARM, AArch64 (intersection with the SDK). Unknown or missing
  backends fail; there is no host fallback.
- Verification runs before and after optimization; it checks IR validity, not
  Erlang correctness.
- Budgets per target: 1,024 modules, 250,000 AST nodes per module, 1,000,000 per
  batch. Serialized output: 64 MiB per module, 256 MiB per batch. Exceeding a
  budget is an ordinary resource diagnostic.

## LLVM SDK

Stable LLVM **23.1.x**, minimum 23.1.1. LLVM is a host dependency: architecture,
C++ standard library and Windows CRT must match the compiler tool. Project code
keeps exceptions/RTTI; no exception may unwind through LLVM. The runtime never
uses LLVM.

- Discovery searches standard prefixes (`/usr`, `/usr/local`, `/opt/homebrew`,
  `/opt/local`, `/opt/llvm`, Linuxbrew, `/Library/Developer/Toolchains`,
  Program Files on Windows), including versioned layouts. Build trees are rejected.
- `LLVM_DIR` selects an SDK explicitly; invalid selections fail without fallback.
- If none is found, CMake downloads the pinned **23.1.2** archive (SHA-256
  checked) into `thirdparty/` for Windows x64/ARM64, Linux x64/ARM64 or macOS
  ARM64. `CLAUSE_DOWNLOAD_LLVM=OFF` disables downloads.
- A configure-time link probe checks ABI compatibility.

Reference Windows x64 setup (2026-09-29): host clang-cl 23.1.2 in
`C:/Program Files/LLVM/bin`, SDK `thirdparty/clang+llvm-23.1.2-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`,
Visual Studio 18 x64 tools, Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0, Ninja, `/MT`,
`_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=0`. Automatic selection applies the `/MT` and iterator
settings; an explicit `LLVM_DIR` does not, and the link probe then fails.

Historical macOS reference: Homebrew `llvm` 23.1.1_1 (arm64, shared
`libLLVM.23.1.dylib`, assertions off) with AppleClang 21.

Other prerequisites: CMake ≥ 3.28, a C++23 compiler, Boost ≥ 1.90, toml++
3.4.0 and the quality tools. OTP is needed only for opt-in audits and fixture
regeneration.
