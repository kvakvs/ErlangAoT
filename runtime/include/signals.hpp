// The links, monitors, registered name and exit trapping of one process (docs/processes.md#links, #monitors,
// #registered-names): the pids of the processes it is linked to, in the order the links were made, the monitors it
// holds and those held on it, its name, and whether exit signals reach it as messages. Links, monitors and the name
// change only under the executor's lock, also while the process runs; exit trapping only by the process itself.
