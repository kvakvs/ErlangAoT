# Project memory — 2026-10-03

Completed pattern/guard steps 1–20 and added15a are archived in .agents/00-finished.md.
The retired checklist was removed by user request; durable context is .agents/11-plan.md#completed-patternmatch.
No subagents authorized or used. Separate current commits: step17 7d83b99,
step18 684af35, step19 428c388; final step20 commit 2be9626.
Each implementation commit followed fresh combined Debug build/fullCTest/Lizard/tidy.

Current admitted scope: acyclic local/exported remote functions, ordered heads,
body matches/sequences, grouped/strict/lazy guards, rooted checked construction/
access/comparison/numeric services for owned atoms, arbitrary integers, finite
floats, tuple/list/string/map/bitstring/ordinary tuple records. Descriptor ABI4,
checked failure channel2; ownership checked before extraction, handoff before pop.
Guards reject reached semantic errors; infrastructure failures halt. Specs grant
no representation authority. Clause candidates isolate SSA, facts index successful
whole-value assignments; extracted/unproved values stay top. Specialization/work/
IR caps unchanged; generic fallback verifies.

Planning update2026-10-03 (rewrite): user deleted 51-step draft; .agents/11-plan.md now
78 small single-commit steps, phases A-N, each with success criteria+tests. Exes early
(3-8) so later steps test via executable golden runner (step8). Decisions: 3 entry,17 frame
model,24 GC policy,53 ports,71-77 D-items. Mandatory1-70+78. 01-todo links remapped.

OTP source cleanup2026-10-03: replaced130 notice-bearing fixture source files and
removed copied assertion/file headers+license. Local source fixtures now under
tests/fixtures/patternmatch/fragments (222 Erlang/include files+corpus.json).
authored.py stages fixed local inputs; stored.py resolves source/observation roots.
Regeneration observes local code, never extracts OTP source. Keep observations
committed per explicit user answer; OTP source/generated headers/audits transient.
erlfmt installed+moved to ignored thirdparty/tools/erlfmt per user instruction;
valid source/header and changed term files formatted. Preserve user's AGENTS edits.

narrowing C4244/C4267 from LLVM headers; disabled only on erlang_aot_parser_dependency and
erlang_llvm_sdk interfaces for cl. erlang_aot builds under cl; runtime still fails cl C4554
