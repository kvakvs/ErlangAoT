# Missing features and completion backlog

Stable feature owners for the remaining work (created 2026-09-30 from
[outstanding work](00-finished.md#outstanding-work-to-finish), compacted
2026-10-04 and 2026-10-10). [Plan 11](11-plan.md) orders it into small steps.
IDs are references, not priorities. Checked items are delivered scoped slices;
parsed syntax, API sketches and placeholders do not count as support. Full
wording of delivered items is in Git history and [completed work](00-finished.md).

## Shared completion checklist

For each implemented slice: define behavior, exclusions and failures; settle
representation, ownership and ABI first; test through real sources, CLI,
executables and OTP comparisons, keeping justified invariant and fault tests;
replace placeholders only for implemented semantics; update docs, `arch.md`,
`files.md`; format and pass the fresh combined Debug gate without weakened
checks. OTP-dependent work starts by refreshing `maint-29` per
[otp-reference.md](../docs/otp-reference.md).

## Open items

### Executables and runtime data

- **F01 — Executable startup and linking** (3–8, 43, 58; delivered: entry,
  startup, linking, runtime options, program fixtures end to end):
  [ ] `--args-file` options file like `vm.args` (reserved; reports not
  implemented).
- **F04 — Process garbage collection** (8A–8I, 23–27A, 51; delivered: Cheney
  collector, generated-code triggers, defined exhaustion, caps,
  `garbage_collect/0`): [ ] optional later: generational old heap with minor
  collections.
- **F05 — Graph copying and process isolation** (28, 45; delivered:
  sharing-preserving copies between heaps of one runtime): [ ] cross-runtime
  atom/identity handling (cross-runtime copies are `wrong_owner`).
- **F11 — Floating-point values** (38; delivered: finite binary64 values,
  operations, conversions): [ ] broader numeric scope when selected.

### Language semantics

- **F20 — Erlang exceptions** (11–15; delivered: raise classes, `catch`,
  `try`/`of`/`catch`/`after`, stack traces, `raise/3`): [ ] nested handling and
  cleanup across module and builtin calls.

### Optimization

- **F34 — Precise type inference** ([58A](11-plan.md#step-58a)–[58N3](11-plan.md#step-58n3);
  delivered: fact domain, literal/operator/container/fun facts, caller
  inputs, narrowing by patterns, guards and uses, spec contradictions,
  per-clause function types and call selection, per-call re-analysis,
  dependent facts of `case`/`if`/`try ... of`, nonempty list cells, `apply/2,3` calls,
  `--print-types` trailing `% Type` notes; contract
  [semantic](../docs/semantic.md#inference)):
  [ ] a `case` on a variable that itself depends on an argument splitting over
  that argument; [ ] optional report of calls no function type admits.
  Expectations: `tests/fixtures/inference/` (values 143, base_types 46,
  narrowing 53, clauses 53, dependent 25 functions) and `contracts/`.

### Validation obligations

Keep historical results with their original hosts and revisions.

- **V01 — Native platform matrix** ([63](11-plan.md#step-63)–[66](11-plan.md#step-66);
  delivered: Linux x86-64, 32-bit x86 runtime on Windows/Linux, Linux
  AArch64/armhf under qemu-user): [ ] native ARM hardware; [ ] macOS Apple
  Silicon (66, also `dsymutil` for F30).
- **V03 — Broader OTP compatibility** ([69](11-plan.md#step-69); delivered:
  pin refreshed, program fixtures goldened and matched as executables, steps
  1, 2, 58): [ ] upstream Common Test suites and wider differential
  comparisons.
- **V04 — Remaining test migration** ([70](11-plan.md#step-70); delivered:
  executable golden runner, step 8): [ ] audit the
  [ledger](../docs/validation.md#test-design) and retire covered adapters.

## Optional or explicitly deferred scope

Each ends in a recorded selection, deferral or omission; omission is never
checked as implemented.

- **D01 — Dynamic modules and code upgrades** ([71](11-plan.md#step-71)):
  static-only, native dynamic libraries, or an upgrade model.
- **D02 — Atom collection** ([72](11-plan.md#step-72)): bounded permanent
  storage versus collection.
- **D03 — Behavior-changing attributes and transforms**
  ([73](11-plan.md#step-73)): compile options, parse transforms, on-load;
  `-behaviour` implemented by [65A](11-plan.md#step-65a);
  `module_info/0,1` and informational attributes implemented by
  [65B](11-plan.md#step-65b).
- **D04 — Public stage interchange** ([74](11-plan.md#step-74)): only for a
  concrete consumer.
- **D05 — Intermediate-stage readers** ([75](11-plan.md#step-75)): directories
  reserved only.
- **D06 — C/FFI interoperability** ([76](11-plan.md#step-76)): only for a
  concrete external caller.
- **D07 — Project schema extensions** ([77](11-plan.md#step-77)): defaults,
  profiles, dependencies, exclusions, fetching, watch/cache, parallel builds.
